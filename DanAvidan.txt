We're putting an A/V presentation together for our wedding and we'd love to get a short recording of you introducing Starlight Brigade, since we'll be playing the music video for it. We're calling our wedding "The Union Tour" as if it were a concert, and we have a bunch of music videos playing on projector screens around the venue. It would be awesome if you could say something along the lines of:

  "Hi, I'm Dan Avidan, and you're at The Union Tour. <Any congratulations you want to say>. I hope you all enjoy my song coming up next, Starlight Brigade."
  
Thank you so much!
