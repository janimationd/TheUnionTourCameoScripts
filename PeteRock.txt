We're putting an A/V presentation together for our wedding and we'd love to get a short recording of you introducing They Reminisce Over You, since we'll be playing the music video for it. We're calling our wedding "The Union Tour" as if it were a concert, and we have a bunch of music videos playing on projector screens around the venue. It would be dope if you could say something along the lines of:

  "<Introduce yourself>, and you're at The Union Tour. <Any congratulations you want to say>. I hope you all enjoy my track coming up next, They Reminisce Over You."
  
Thank you so much! If you have any questions you can reach me at janimationd@gmail.com. I will respond quickly :)
